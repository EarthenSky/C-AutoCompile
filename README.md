# C-AutoCompile

This program automatically generates and runs build commands for a program, as long as all source files are in the same folder.
This program also generates a build comments file that depicts the user inputted comment for each build.

This program interacts with g++ and windres. (so only windows, probably)
It also compiles resource files each time it builds. (using windres)
